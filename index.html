        <h3>Dynamic Expense Chart</h3>

        <p> This is an expense chart component. It displays the amount of money spend in a week as a bar graph. The day
          when the most money was spent is highlighted
          as a blue bar. When the user mouses over a bar, the numerical total for that day is displayed over the bar.
          This page uses a <b>JSON</b> file to get the amount of money spent,
          so it is <b>dynamic</b> and can easily be updated with new data.

        <p>This is my business card. It was created in React. It was designed by <a

          executed by me.</p>
        <p>This page was created in React. There were a few opportunities for me to use reusable components. For
          example,
          the picture grid at the bottom show casing their past projects. That section also allowed me to use a <a

        <p>This is a calculator built in React. It supports all basic calculator functions. It also displays the

          project.
