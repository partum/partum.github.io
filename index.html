    <h1>Hey there, <br> I'm Julia Arrington</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="body-container">
    <p>I am a front-end web developer. I like to create websites that are user friendly and interesting. I currently
      work
      at Aisle Rocket, creating and modifying pages for Fortune 500 companies that engage and inform consumers.</p>
    <p>I am working to improve my design skills and learning more about React.</p>
    <p>When Iâ€™m not working, I like to play RPGs, read fantasy novels, and cook.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>This is a landing page for a fictional company. It was designed by <a
          title="visit the Front End Mentor challenge page"
          href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw">Front End Mentor</a> and
        executed by me.</p>
      <p>This page was created in React. There were a few opportunities for me to use reusable components. For example,
        the picture grid at the bottom show casing their past projects. That section also allowed me to use a <a
          title="GitHub repository of the React responsive module"
          href="https://github.com/yocontra/react-responsive">new-to-me module to add media responsive images</a>.</p>
